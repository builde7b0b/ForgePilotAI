Build SaaS like a team of ten—powered by AI agents.
ForgePilot exists to eliminate the solo founder bottleneck. We enable one person to launch ten SaaS products by automating every stage of the startup lifecycle: ideation, development, hosting, copywriting, billing, and distribution.

## 🧠 The Big Idea
We’re building a full-stack AI agent platform that operates like a startup team in a box—capable of launching and iterating on micro-SaaS products autonomously.

AI agents (LangGraph, MemGPT, Anthropic) can now reason across dev workflows.

Open-source SaaS kits + cloud infra (Supabase, Vercel) make shipping near-instant.

Solo founder movement is surging (Reddit, IndieHackers, Twitter).

Founder burnout is real—ForgePilot replaces repetition with automation.

## 🌎 Vision
Our approach aligns with YC’s golden rule:

“Make something people want—and scale it fast.”

ForgePilot taps into real-time demand signals to identify market needs and deploy production-ready tools on autopilot.

The next YC unicorn might be built by 1 person with 10 agents.
We're building the platform to make that happen.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
ForgePilot is built on battle-tested modern tools, optimized for speed and automation:

- Frontend: React
- AI Agent Frameworks: LangChain, LangGraph, MemGPT
- APIs: OpenAPI
- Backend + Infra: Supabase, Vercel

We're designing the platform to be modular and open—bring your own components, plug into the ForgePilot runtime, and deploy in minutes.

## ✨ TL;DR
AI agents that build SaaS companies → more founders winning → more shots on goal → more YC-worthy startups.

## 🛠️ Status
Currently in alpha. We're actively building, experimenting, and testing new workflows with real users. Want to help shape the future? Open an issue or join our waitlist to get early access.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate
We're looking for builders, researchers, and founders who want to push the limits of what's possible with autonomous startup creation.

Let me know if you’d like a shorter version, or one geared more toward devs, investors, or potential users.
